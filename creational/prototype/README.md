# Prototype design pattern

## This pattern is used when 
### 1). Object creation costly 
### 2). More resource needed
### 3). Takes more time
## to create object and you have similar object already exists

## It provides mechanism to copy original using cloning and modifying according to new object requirements.

## NOTE: while copying child object do not copy reference instead create new child object then copy data from prototype object
