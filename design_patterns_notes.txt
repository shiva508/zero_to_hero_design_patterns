Singleton Design pattern
Java Singleton Pattern is one of the Gangs of Four Design patterns and comes in the Creational Design Pattern category.

->It is creational design pattern, delas with cotrolling creation of java objects
->Only one instance of class should exist 
->Other classes should be able to get instance of Singleton class.
->Used in Logging,Cache,Drivers,Session

    •*** Implementation
->Constructor should be private(if it is public user can create many instances of it so making private )
->Public method for returning instance
->Instance type private,static
(Using private constructor we can ensure that no more than one object can be created at a time. 
By providing a private constructor you prevent class instances from being created in any place 
other than this very class.)
