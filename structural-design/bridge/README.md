# Bridge design pattern

## Bridge is a structural design pattern that lets you split a large class or a set of closely 
## related classes into two separate hierarchies—abstraction and implementation—which can be developed independently of each other.
## The implementation of bridge design pattern follows the notion to prefer Composition over inheritance.
