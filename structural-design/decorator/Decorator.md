# Decorator
## Decorator is a structural design pattern that lets you attach new behaviors to objects by placing these objects inside special wrapper objects that contain the behaviors.
## In the implementation of this pattern, we prefer composition over an inheritance â€“ so that we can reduce the overhead of subclassing again and again for each decorating element. 
## The recursion involved with this design can be used to decorate our object as many times as we require.
